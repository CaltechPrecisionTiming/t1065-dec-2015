\section{Introduction} 

There has been much recent interest in highly granular calorimeters with 
precision timing capability at the level of $20-30$~ps for the High-Luminosity
LHC and future higher energy hadron colliders. In order to probe increasingly
rare interactions, future hadron colliders must provide an increase in the
instantaneous luminosity well above $10^{35}\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.
With current accelerator and particle detector capabilities, such a high 
instantaneous luminosity will invariably result in very large amounts
of pileup, exceeding several hundreds of simultaneous inelastic collisions per
bunch crossing. The ability to discriminate between particles produced by 
different inelastic collisions will be essential for future particle detector
systems. Detectors capable of measuring the time of arrival of particles
very precisely can be used to discriminate between particles produced by
different inelastic collisions at different physical locations along the beam
axis. Taking the beam bunch profile of the LHC as the model for future
colliders, a detector that can measure the time of arrival of a particle
with a precision of $20-30$~ps can effectively reduce the impact of
pileup by a factor of $5$ to $10$. 

Much recent interest has focused on highly granular calorimeters based on 
silicon sensors as the active material~\cite{CALICE,HGCal}, due to
radiation hardness considerations as well as maturity of the silicon sensor
technology. In this article, we propose the first studies of a 
calorimeter prototype using Cadmium Telluride (CdTe) sensors as the 
active material. CdTe has been studied extensively in the context
of thin film solar cells and has become a mature and wide-spread
technology~\cite{CdTeSolar}. It has also been used as a radiation
detector for nuclear spectroscopy, and is known to have high
quantum efficiency for photons in the x-ray range of the spectrum.
This feature is of particular interest in the context of its use
in calorimetery because it would be uniquely sensitive to secondary
electromagnetic shower particles in the keV range. Conventional prototypes 
using silicon or scintillator material is not directly sensitive to such high 
energy shower secondaries. Therefore, the first study of electromagnetic
showers using CdTe sensors has the potential to yield new insight
into the behavior of secondary particles produced within an 
electromagnetic shower with energies in the keV range, and has the potential
to yield an improvement on the energy measurement due to
the additional contribution of the higher energy x-ray photons to which previous
calorimeters were not sensitive.

The recent interest in precision timing capabilities has intensified
the study of the timing properties of silicon sensors. They have been
shown to yield $20$~ps level precision given sufficiently large signal size
in a variety of applications ranging from calorimetery~\cite{SiliconTiming} to 
charged particle detectors~\cite{santacruz}. The signal formation process
in CdTe sensors are very similar to the process in silicon and has 
similar potential to yield precise timestamps.

In this article, we study the signal response of the CdTe sensor to electromagnetic
showers of varying energies and at different shower depths. We also study the timing
performance of the CdTe sensors for electromagnetic showers.

\section{Test-beam Setup and Experimental Apparatus }
\label{sec:tbeam}

We performed the test-beam measurements at the H2 beamline of the CERN North-Area testbeam facility
and the T9 beamline of the CERN East-Area testbeam facility. They provide secondary electron beams 
from the Proton Synchrotron (PS) and Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS)
of energies ranging from $2$~GeV to $200$~GeV. The secondary beams are composed of 
a mixture of electrons, pions, and muons. 

Trigger counters made of photomultipliers coupled to plastic scintillators are used 
to initiate the read out of the data acquisition (DAQ) system. The DAQ system
uses a CAEN V1742 switched capactor digitizer based on the DRS4 chip. Gas wire chambers
are used to measure the position of each incident beam particle in the plane transverse
to the beamline. A stack of lead or tungsten absorbers of different thicknesses are 
placed about $5$~mm in front of the Cadmium Telluride (CdTe) sensor, which is 
enclosed within a metal box covered by copper foil. We amplified the size of the
signals from the CdTe sensor using a Hamamatsu C5594 amplifier with a bandwidth of
$1.5$~GHz and providing a voltage gain of $36$~dB. A micro-channel plate photomultiplier (MCP-PMT)
detector is used to provide a very precise reference timestamp. At the T9 beamline,
a Hamamatsu R3809U MCP-PMT is placed just upstream of the absorber material. 
At the H2 beamline a Photek 240 MCP-PMT is used, which contains a significant 
amount of absorber material (about 1.8 radiation lengths), and is therefore placed 
just downstream of the CdTe sensor to avoid inducing an early electromagnetic shower.
The precision of the time measurement for both types of MCP-PMT's is less than 
$10$~ps~\cite{Ronzhin2015288}. The purity of the electron beam at the T9 beamline is
significantly lower than at the H2 beamline, and therefore we use a LYSO crystal
optically coupled to an MCP-PMT as a means of discriminating the electrons from the pions
in the beam. The schematic diagrams of the experimental setups at H2 and T9 
are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:BeamSchematicDiagram}.

\end{figure} 


The X and Y position measurements from the wire chamber are used to determine the location
of the CdTe sensor relative to the beam and to align the beam. In 
Figure~\ref{fig:BeamSensorPosition}, we show plots of the average amplitude measured in the
CdTe sensor as a function of the X and Y positions as measured by the wire chamber. Based
on these plots, we can restrict our measurements to the electrons whose impact point is close
to the center of the CdTe sensor.

the horizontal and vertical positions of the beam particle as measured by the wire chamber.}

\end{figure} 


\section{Event Reconstruction and Selection }
\label{sec:reco}

Signals from each detector is recorded by the CAEN V1742 digitizer at $0.2$~ns time intervals.
The baseline pedestal for each channel is determined using the time samples outside of
the signal window, and is subsequently subtracted from the signal pulses. Examples of recorded
signal waveforms in the CdTe sensor for electromagnetic showers are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Pulses}.
Using randomly triggered data, we measured the RMS of the noise for the channel reading out 
the CdTe sensor to be about $1.2-1.3$~mV. 

%Fig: Pulse shapes for various energies
\begin{figure}[htbp] 
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{figures/TypicalPulses.pdf}
\includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{figures/TypicalPulses_Zoom.pdf} 
\caption{Examples of signal pulses in the CdTe sensor for electrons with energies of $50$~GeV,
$100$~GeV, and $200$~GeV. Right: Zoom in of the example pulses.} 
\label{fig:Pulses} 
\end{figure} 

The total charge collected in each channel is obtained by computing the integral of the pulse
waveform. The time stamp for each signal is reconstructed by fitting the pulse waveform with
an appropriate functional form. For signal pulses from the MCP-PMT's, used as reference timers, 
we fit a gaussian function to a $1.5$~ns window around the peak of the pulse and extract the 
timestamp $t_{0}$ as the mean parameter of the gaussian function. For signal pulses from the
CdTe sensor, we fit a linear function to time sample points between $10\%$ and $60\%$ of the pulse
maximum and the timestamp $t_{1}$ is assigned as the time at which the fitted linear function
rises to $30\%$ of the pulse maximum. More details of the time stamp reconstruction can be
found in reference~\cite{Anderson:2015gha}.


Based on the results shown in Figure~\ref{fig:BeamSensorPosition}, we select events
for which the incident beam particle lies within the geometric area covered by the 
CdTe sensor. The region with X coordinate between $2.5$~mm and $13.5$~mm and
Y coordinate between $-8.0$~mm and $2.0$~mm is selected. We require that the 
signal in the reference MCP-PMT detector has an amplitude larger than $25$~mV. 
For data collected at the H2 beamline, the MCP-PMT detector is located behind
the absorbers and can disriminate between electrons that shower in the absorber
material and pions that do not. We require that the signal amplitude in the 
MCP-PMT detector is larger than $500$~mV to select a pure sample of electrons. For
data collected at the T9 beamline, the electron selection is performed using
the LYSO scintillating crystal placed behind the absorber material and the CdTe sensor,
as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:BeamSchematicDiagram}. The electromagnetic shower particles produce
scintillation light in the LYSO crystal and are read out by an MCP-PMT. We require that
the signal amplitude in the MCP-PMT coupled to the LYSO crystal is larger than $800$~mV
to select a sample of pure electrons. Furthermore, as the precision of the beam particle position 
measured by the wire chambers at the T9 beamline is relatively poor, we also require
large signals in the $1$~cm~$\times$~$1$~cm scintillator trigger counter, with
amplitude above $150$~mV, to constrain the beam to a smaller geometric region. 


\section{Calorimetric Measurements} 
\label{sec:calorimetery} 

To obtain a preliminary characterization of the calorimetric performance 
of the CdTe sensors, we measure the total charge collected out of the CdTe 
sensor for various incident electron beam energies. Examples of the 
charge distributions are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ChargeDistribution}
for $2$~GeV and $200$~GeV electrons.

%Fig: Charge distributions (noise, showers, MIP?)
\begin{figure}[htbp] 
\centering

\caption{Distribution of total charge collected in the CdTe sensor for a $2$~GeV
electron after $2$~$\mathrm{X}_{0}$ of lead absorber (left) and a 200~GeV
electron after $6$~$\mathrm{X}_{0}$ of tungsten absorber (right). } 
\label{fig:ChargeDistribution} 
\end{figure} 

We plot the mean collected charge as a function of the incident beam energy
in Figure~\ref{fig:ChargeVsEnergy} and observe that the signal size scales
up with increasing beam energy. The measured resolution is shown by the green
error bars in Figure~\ref{fig:ChargeVsEnergy}, and is about $50\%$ for electrons
in the range of a few GeV and about $30\%$ for electrons above $50$~GeV. 
These resolution measurements are encouraging given that they are performed
using only a single layer sample covering a relatively small transverse
geometric area. In future studies, we intend to complete measurements of the
longitudinal shower profile and to instrument a larger transverse geometric
area to improve the transverse shower containment.

while the green error bars show the measured resolution. The red line is a 
linear fit to each set of measured data. } 
\label{fig:ChargeVsEnergy} 
\end{figure} 



\section{Timing Measurements} 
\label{sec:timing} 

We characterize the timing performance of the CdTe sensor by measuring the timestamps
relative to the MCP-PMT device used as a reference timer. An example of the timestamp
measurement distribution for $100$~GeV electrons after $6$~$\mathrm{X}_{0}$ of absorber
material is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:DeltaT}. We study whether there is any significant
dependence of the timestamp measurement on the amplitude of the signal, and the
result is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:DeltaTVsAmplitude}. No significant amplitude dependence
is observed for signals from the CdTe sensor.

\label{fig:DeltaTVsAmplitude} 
\end{figure} 


We show the dependence of the timestamp measurement as a function of the geometric
position of the incident beam particle as measured by the wire chambers in 
Figure~\ref{fig:DeltaTVsBeamXY}, and we observe a clear linear dependence.
This geometric position non-uniformity of the time response adds significantly to the 
time resolution ($XX$~ps). Performing a correction for this non-uniformity results
in a time resolution of $YY$~ps.

and the time measured in the CdTe sensor relative to the Photek reference detector

of the beam particle position is shown in the black points.} 
\label{fig:DeltaTVsBeamXY} 
\end{figure} 


The measured time resolution as a function of the beam energy is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:ChargeVsEnergy}.

\caption{ The measured time resolution of the CdTe sensor is plotted as a function
of the electron beam energy. } 
\label{fig:ChargeVsEnergy} 
\end{figure} 

Including the position non-uniformity correction, we obtain a time resolution of $20$~ps
for electrons with energy above $100$~GeV. 


To further characterize the timing performance of the CdTe signals, we measure the
risetime, defined as the time for the signal to rise from $10\%$ to $90\%$ of the maximum
amplitude, for various electron beam energies. The distribution of risetime for
$100$~GeV electrons are shown on the left of Figure~\ref{fig:riseTime}. The 
measured risetime as a function of the beam energy is shown on the right of 
Figure~\ref{fig:riseTime}. We observe a risetime that is relatively stable
at around $1.3$~ns.

\section{Discussion and Summary}
\label{sec:summary} 


In this article, we describe the first measurement of high energy 
electromagnetic showers using Cadmium Telluride sensors. The signal response
is consistent with expectations and show ....[to be checked more carefully]...compared to silicon.
These initial results are encouraging and motivate future work on 
more detailed comparisons with simulation and more detailed 
measurements of transverse and longitudinal shower profiles.


The energy loss per $\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ mass density 
for a minimum ionizing particle (MIP) is $1.66$~MeV$\mathrm{g}^{-1}\mathrm{cm}^{2}$~\cite{PDG}. 
For CdTe, with a density of $6.2\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$, the energy
loss is $1.03$~keV/$\mu$m. The mean energy to produce an electron hole pair
in CdTe is $4.43$~eV~\cite{Sze,Singh}, resulting in a signal size of
233 electron hole pairs per $\mu$m thickness per MIP, or $37$~fC/mm per
MIP. This signal size for the CdTe sensor is a factor of $2.2$ larger per unit thickness
than for silicon sensors. 
%Based on Figure~\ref{figures/ChargeVsEnergyAt6X0.pdf}, we project that at 32~GeV after $6$~$X_{0}$ 
%of absorber, the total charge collected is $2.3$~pC, which amounts to about $62$ MIP-equivalent
%signals. This is larger than the measured value of $54$ for silicon sensors under the same
%beam energy and absorber thickness conditions. The extra signal may be a result of additional
%sensitivity to keV range photons produced in the electromagnetic shower.




We have measured the rise time for signals in the CdTe sensor to be about $1.3$~ns, which
is relatively fast and suggests that there is potential for excellent time precision.
We observe dependencies of the measured time on the geometric position of the
incident beam particle, which is likely due to differences in the charge collection
path. More detailed studies of this aspect are needed and a more optimal design of the 
readout system is possible. Correcting for these dependencies yield time precision results
of $25$~ps for a single layer CdTe sensor of transverse area $1$~cm$\times$~$1$~cm
sampling the electromagnetic shower of a $200$~GeV electron after $6$ radiation lengths. 
These initial results are encouraging and motivate further in-depth studies in the
future.
